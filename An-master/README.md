## ⚙️ How to Personalize for Yourself (`constant/` Folder)

You don't need to dive deep into complex UI components to change your information! All personal data, projects, work experience, and social handles live inside the `constant/` directory:

```text
constant/
├── profile.ts      # Bio, location, education, rotating hero headlines
├── projects.ts     # Selected & featured projects, tech tags, links
├── experience.ts   # Work experience timeline & job roles
├── skills.ts       # Categorized skills & technology badges
├── social.ts       # Social media platforms, URLs, handles & icons
├── seo.ts          # Default SEO title, OpenGraph images, site URL
└── index.ts        # Barrel export for all constants
```

### Quick Editing Checklist

1. **`constant/profile.ts`**: Update your name, email, current work title, college/education, location, bio paragraphs, and hero rotating quotes (`hero_titles`).
2. **`constant/projects.ts`**: Update `selected_works` and `works` arrays with your own projects, tech stack badges, and GitHub/live links.
3. **`constant/experience.ts`**: Edit your work history, company names, job titles, start/end dates, and key achievements.
4. **`constant/skills.ts`**: Add or remove your core skills and tech categories.
5. **`constant/social.ts`**: Set your GitHub, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), LeetCode, and other social media profile links.
6. **`constant/seo.ts`**: Set `SITE_SEO.siteName`, `SITE_SEO.siteTitle`, and `SITE_SEO.siteUrl` to match your domain.

## 📝 Connecting Notion for Dynamic Blogs

This portfolio uses **Notion** as a headless CMS. You write your articles in Notion, and they render seamlessly on your site at `/blogs`.

Here is how to set up Notion integration step-by-step:

### Step 1: Create a Notion Integration

1. Visit [Notion My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
2. Click **"+ New integration"**.
3. Select your workspace, enter an integration name (e.g., `My Portfolio Blog`), and click **Submit**.
4. Copy the **Internal Integration Secret** (it starts with `secret_` or `ntn_`).
5. Save this token as `NOTION_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file.

### Step 2: Create Your Notion Database

1. Open Notion and create a new **Full Page Database** (or inline database on a new page).
2. Set up the following database properties (**property names are case-sensitive**):

| Property Name   | Property Type in Notion              | Description                                            |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**       | `Title`                              | The blog post title                                    |
| **Slug**        | `Text` (Rich Text)                   | URL slug for post (e.g. `building-my-portfolio`)       |
| **Description** | `Text` (Rich Text)                   | Short excerpt/description displayed on blog list       |
| **Keywords**    | `Multi-select`                       | Tags or keywords for SEO & topics                      |
| **Date**        | `Date`                               | Publication date                                       |
| **Published**   | `Checkbox`                           | Must be **checked** (`true`) for the post to show live |
| **Cover**       | `Files & media` or Notion Page Cover | Post cover thumbnail image                             |

### Step 3: Connect Database to Your Integration

1. Open your Notion Blog Database page.
2. Click the three dots `...` (or **Share** button) in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Add connections** (or **Connections**).
4. Search for your integration name (e.g., `My Portfolio Blog`) and grant it access.

### Step 4: Find Your Database ID

1. Copy the URL of your Notion Database page.
2. The URL looks like this:
   `https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/3a648e834e8348986e9d7281e46a56e?v=...`
3. The 32-character string between `myworkspace/` and `?v=` is your `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`.
4. Add `NOTION_DATABASE_ID=3a648e834e8348986e9d7281e46a56e` to `.env.local`.

### Step 5: Write Your First Blog

1. Add a new row to your Notion database.
2. Give it a **Title**, a unique **Slug** (e.g. `hello-world`), a **Description**, a **Date**, and check the **Published** box.
3. Open the page inside Notion and write your article content using standard Notion blocks (headings, code blocks, lists, callouts, images).
4. Refresh your portfolio's `/blogs` page — your article is now live! 🎉

## 📧 Connecting Gmail for Contact Form Submissions

The contact form uses **Nodemailer** with Gmail SMTP to send notification emails when a visitor sends you a message.

To connect your Gmail account securely:

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

1. Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Security**.
3. Under _"How you sign in to Google"_, make sure **2-Step Verification** is turned **ON**.

### Step 2: Generate a Gmail App Password

1. Search for **"App passwords"** in the Google Account search bar (or go directly to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)).
2. Enter an app name (e.g., `Portfolio Contact Form`).
3. Click **Create**.
4. Google will generate a 16-character passcode (e.g. `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`). Copy this passcode.

### Step 3: Add Credentials to `.env.local`

Add your email address and the generated App Password to `.env.local`:

```env
email_from=your.email@gmail.com
email_password=abcdefghijklmnop
```

Now, when visitors submit the contact form on your site, Nodemailer will send the message using your Gmail SMTP server!

## 🔒 Environment Variables Reference

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Email Configuration (Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP)
email_from=your.email@gmail.com
email_password=your_16_char_google_app_password

# Notion CMS Integration
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_integration_secret_token
